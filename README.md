Unit 1 Homework Assignment: FinTech Case Study

## Overview and Origin
Newton is a crypto currency trading platform focused on the Canadian user base. Founded in 2018, it is a privately held company and is headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Newton was started by a team of experienced Canadian entrepreneurs and has strong financial backing. It has raised a total of US$34.7M in funding over 2 rounds and has a valuation of about US$200M. Newton's founder and CEO is Dustin Walper, who found success with his telehealth start-up Akira and is now looking to tackle the equally challenging cryptocurrency industry. He believes that crypto has a lot of potential and the technology behind it can change the way our financial system works. Walper knows that currently cryptocurrency “is kind of a sketchy area.” Their goal is to set a strong example for good corporate citizenship in the cryptocurrency space.

## Business Activities
Transparency and air-tight security in the crypto space is paramount. To help improve the trust and usage of cryptocurrencies in Canada, Newton is basing a good part of their identity on transparency. The company website says that customer data is stored in Canada, it is PIPEDA-compliant, FINTRAC ready, and offers an exportable T5 statement. Newton also values security and will store 95% of the digital currency it holds offline, as well as performing daily off-site backups. Walper says the security considerations are similar to what he experienced at Akira, where patient privacy and security was a top concern. 

Walper told Bitcoin Magazine what some critics have already been saying, that bitcoin mass adoption will only come when trading is made easier and cheaper. Newton is supported on iOS, Android and web. It offers 70+ coins on its exchange and makes money by capturing the bid-ask spread difference from their users directly. The spread is the lowest in the industry and conspicuously displayed on their website.

## Landscape
Newton is a cryptocurrency exchange start-up. Over the past few years, interest in cryptocurrency has grown exponentially because of its attractiveness to people looking to use this alternative money. Besides the finance sector, a number of use cases have been developed over the last few years

1. Ethical business practices
Cryptocurrency can also be used to encourage ethical business practices. Because blockchain makes it possible to track every transaction with complete transparency, businesses with a record of human rights abuses -- the fishing industry, for instance, -- will (hopefully) take on more ethical business practices.

4. Battling electoral fraud
Another ethical application of cryptocurrency will be its ability to help battle electoral fraud. Santiago Siri is the co-founder of Democracy Earth, a non-profit that's designing an app to combine voting with blockchain technology. Siri says that with cryptocurrency, electoral fraud -- or any other kind of corruption involving money -- will no longer be possible.

5. De-corrupting charities
Additionally, cryptocurrency can be used to avoid corruption in charitable organizations. Because of its ability to keep companies accountable, blockchain can eliminate many problems occurring with charities, such as fund leaks. That's why the World Food Programme (WFP) is using blockchain to securely distribute cash assistance to the hungry.

6. Going green
If you're an environmentalist, you'll be happy to hear that cryptocurrency can be used to make the world greener, too. For example, there's the Brooklyn Microgrid. With this system, people who already have solar panels are able to sell environmental credits through a phone app, to residents who don't have direct access -- which means using less carbon-based power and more solar-based energy.

7.Travel
As Bitcoin becomes accepted by more and more retailers, people are going to have the chance to use them for a huge number of transactions. Travel transactions are just one category. The website cheapair.com, a travel agency where you can purchase flights, hotels, car rentals and cruises, has been accepting Bitcoin since 2013.

8. Education
More and more, schools are accepting cryptocurrencies as a form of payment. According to Futurism.com, universities in Switzerland, Germany, Cyprus and the United States have started to accept Bitcoin as payment. This form of payment will surely grow as this currency becomes more and more popular.

Furthermore, blockchain technology has been utilized to create an extremely efficient, cost effecttive and robust solution for document and degree verification and certification. 

9. Fund-raising
Many startups are now using cryptocurrencies in order to fund their ideas, services and products. Instead of using traditional VC funding, or using fund-raising websites such as IndieGoGo or Kickstarter, startup leaders are looking to cryptocurrency as a way to raise money for what they need. Because it's easy to track and obtain money this way, it's revolutionizing the entire fund-raising process.


Alternatives
Just as with any industry, the cryptocurrency exchange industry has to have some competition in order for it to innovate and improve to gain a percentage of the user base. That being the case, when it comes to alternatives to Newton, there are many to choose from. These exchanges are some of the closest to Newton in terms of their offering.
