Unit 1 Homework Assignment: FinTech Case Study

## Overview and Origin
Newton is a crypto currency trading platform focused on the Canadian user base. Founded in 2018, it is a privately held company and is headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Newton was started by a team of experienced Canadian entrepreneurs and has strong financial backing. It has raised a total of US$34.7M in funding over 2 rounds and has a valuation of about US$200M. Newton's founder and CEO is Dustin Walper, who found success with his telehealth start-up Akira and is now looking to tackle the equally challenging cryptocurrency industry. He believes that crypto has a lot of potential and the technology behind it can change the way our financial system works. Walper knows that currently cryptocurrency “is kind of a sketchy area.” Their goal is to set a strong example for good corporate citizenship in the cryptocurrency space.

## Business Activities
Transparency and air-tight security in the crypto space is paramount. To help improve the trust and usage of cryptocurrencies in Canada, Newton is basing a good part of their identity on transparency. The company website says that customer data is stored in Canada, it is PIPEDA-compliant, FINTRAC ready, and offers an exportable T5 statement. Newton also values security and will store 95% of the digital currency it holds offline, as well as performing daily off-site backups. Walper says the security considerations are similar to what he experienced at Akira, where patient privacy and security was a top concern. 

Walper told Bitcoin Magazine what some critics have already been saying, that bitcoin mass adoption will only come when trading is made easier and cheaper. Newton is supported on iOS, Android and web. It offers 70+ coins on its exchange and makes money by capturing the bid-ask spread difference from their users directly. The spread is the lowest in the industry and conspicuously displayed on their website.
