Unit 1 Homework Assignment: FinTech Case Study

---

## **Overview and Origin**
Newton is a low cost crypto currency trading platform focused on the Canadian user base. Founded in 2018 and headquartered in Toronto, it is a privately held company with a company size of about 70 employees. Newton was started by a team of experienced Canadian entrepreneurs and has strong financial backing. It has raised a total of US$34.7M in funding over 2 rounds and has a valuation of about US$200M. Newton's founder and CEO is Dustin Walper, who found success with his telehealth start-up Akira and is now looking to tackle the equally challenging cryptocurrency industry (1). He believes that crypto has a lot of potential and the technology behind it can change the way our financial system works. Walper understands that currently cryptocurrency “is kind of a sketchy area.” His goal is to set a strong example for good corporate citizenship in the cryptocurrency space.

## Business Activities
**Transparency** and **air-tight security** is paramount in the crypto space. To help improve the trust and usage of cryptocurrencies in Canada, Newton is basing a good part of their identity on transparency. The company website says that customer data is stored in Canada, it is PIPEDA-compliant, FINTRAC ready, and offers an exportable T5 statement. Newton also values security and will store 95% of the digital currency it holds offline, as well as performing daily off-site backups. Walper says the security considerations are similar to what he experienced at Akira, where patient privacy and security was a top concern. 
Walper told Bitcoin Magazine that *bitcoin mass adoption will only come when trading is made easier and cheaper.* Newton is supported on iOS, Android and web. It offers the widest selection of coins (70+) on its exchange and makes money by capturing the bid-ask spread difference from their users directly. The spread is the lowest in the industry and conspicuously displayed on their website. Newton is buid and deployed using state-of-the-art technologies like Rust, Golang, Haskell  programming languages and Apache Spark, Flink, Kafka, or AWS Kinesis data pipelines.

## Landscape
Newton is a cryptocurrency exchange start-up. Over the past few years, interest in cryptocurrency has grown exponentially because of its attractiveness to people looking to use this alternative money. Besides the finance sector, a number of other use cases have been developed and adopted (2):

### 1. Ethical business practices

Cryptocurrency can also be used to encourage ethical business practices. Because blockchain makes it possible to track every transaction with complete transparency, businesses with a record of human rights abuses -- the fishing industry, for instance, -- will (hopefully) take on more ethical business practices.

### 2. Battling electoral fraud

Another ethical application of cryptocurrency will be its ability to help battle electoral fraud. Santiago Siri is the co-founder of Democracy Earth, a non-profit that is designing an app to combine voting with blockchain technology. Siri says that with cryptocurrency, electoral fraud -- or any other kind of corruption involving money -- will no longer be possible.

### 3. De-corrupting charities

Additionally, cryptocurrency can be used to avoid corruption in charitable organizations. Because of its ability to keep companies accountable, blockchain can eliminate many problems occurring with charities, such as fund leaks. The World Food Programme (WFP) is using blockchain to securely distribute cash assistance to the hungry.

### 4. Going green

If you're an environmentalist, you'll be happy to hear that cryptocurrency can be used to make the world greener. For example, there is the Brooklyn Microgrid. With this system, people who already have solar panels are able to sell environmental credits through a phone app, to residents who don't have direct access -- which means using less carbon-based power and more solar-based energy.

### 5. Travel

As Bitcoin becomes accepted by more and more retailers, people are going to have the chance to use them for a huge number of transactions. The website https://www.cheapair.com, a travel agency where you can purchase flights, hotels, car rentals and cruises, has been accepting Bitcoin since 2013.

### 6. Education

According to http://www.futurism.com, universities in Switzerland, Germany, Cyprus and the United States have started to accept Bitcoin as payment. This form of payment will surely grow as this currency becomes more and more popular. Furthermore, blockchain technology has been utilized to create an extremely efficient, cost effecttive and robust solution for document and degree verification and certification. 

### 7. Fund-raising

Many startups are now using cryptocurrencies in order to fund their ideas, services and products. Instead of using traditional VC funding, or using fund-raising websites such as IndieGoGo or Kickstarter, startup leaders are looking to cryptocurrency as a way to raise money for what they need. Because it's easy to track and obtain money this way, it's revolutionizing the entire fund-raising process.

Since this is such a burgeoning industry, there are a number of other players in this domain. The competition keeps the companies to innovate and improve to gain a percentage of the user base. The exchanges that are closest to Newton in terms of their offering are (4):

- **Bitbuy.** Assets stored in an offline wallet and insured. Get lower fees with Bitbuy Pro.
- **Coinberry.** Easy verification and insured assets stored in a cold wallet.
- **NDAX.** Extremely fast verification to get you trading quickly. Competitive fees on buy / sell trades.

## Results
Since its inception in the summer of 2018, Newton has been growing by leaps and bounds. A recent round of fundng (US$20M) in February 2022 was oversubscribed and attracted high-profile investors. In May 2021, the Newton customer base crossed 200,000 Canadians and has not slowed down. The core metrics to measure success in this domain are the user base, security, transparency and compliance. Newton has implemented state-of-the-art security paradigm and is brutally transparent about the way it generates money. Not a single instance of security breach has been reported. The CEO doesn't hide behind the veils and is active on different streaming platforms and online journals.

## Recommendations

Crypto prices can shift quickly, making it harder to capitalize on dips or spikes in price by buying or selling at the right time. Additionally, frequent prices changes makes basing your buying and selling around them time consuming. I would advise the company to invest in Autopilot that allows to implement a dollar-cost averaging investment strategy, leading to more consistent returns and hedge against price fluctuations. Autopilot can also save time and takes the emotion out of the investing equation. Below is an image (3) showing the benefits of dollar-cost averaging compared with lump-sum investing, reflected by the average cost per coin.

This new service will help investors by allowing them to concentrate on long-term growth rather than the inconvenience of constantly monitoring cryptocurrency prices. Existing technology and feature set can be enhanced to implement this investment strategy.
